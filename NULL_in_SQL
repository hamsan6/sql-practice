NULL in SQL

- NULL represents an unknown value
- Arithmentic operation involving NULL returns NULL
	- NULL - NULL is NULL
- Boolean comparison with NULL returns NEITHER true nor false, but returns Unknown (in SQL's three-valued logic)
- SQL query only selects value whose 'where' expression evaluates to true, and groups whose 'having' value evaluates to true
- aggregate count(*) counts all NULL and non-NULL tuples
	- count(aggregate) counts all tuples whose value is not NULL
	- other SQL aggregate functions ignore NULL values in their computation
